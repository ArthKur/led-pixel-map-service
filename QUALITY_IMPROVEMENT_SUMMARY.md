# 🎉 HIGH-QUALITY NUMBERING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED

## 📸 Quality Comparison

### BEFORE (Poor Quality - User Feedback):
- Thin, pixelated strokes
- Poor visibility at 15% panel size
- Jagged edges and poor readability
- Basic 7-segment design

### AFTER (High Quality - Current Implementation):
- **Thick strokes**: `max(4, size // 5)` for excellent visibility
- **Rounded line ends**: Professional appearance with ellipse caps
- **Better proportions**: 0.8 width ratio for optimal spacing
- **Enhanced readability**: Clear at all sizes including 15% panel size

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Enhanced `draw_vector_digit()` Function:
```python
def draw_vector_digit(draw, digit, x, y, size, color=(0, 0, 0)):
    # High quality settings
    thickness = max(4, size // 5)  # Much thicker strokes
    width = int(size * 0.8)        # Wider digits
    height = size
    
    # Helper function for thick rounded lines
    def draw_thick_line(x1, y1, x2, y2, thickness):
        draw.line([(x1, y1), (x2, y2)], fill=color, width=thickness)
        # Add rounded ends
        r = thickness // 2
        draw.ellipse([x1-r, y1-r, x1+r, y1+r], fill=color)
        draw.ellipse([x2-r, y2-r, x2+r, y2+r], fill=color)
```

### Key Features:
✅ **Thick Stroke System**: Minimum 4px thickness, scales with size
✅ **Rounded End Caps**: Professional typography appearance
✅ **Optimized Proportions**: 80% width for better spacing
✅ **Scalable Quality**: Excellent at both large and 15% panel sizes
