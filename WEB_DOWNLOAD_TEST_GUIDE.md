## 🌐 WEB DOWNLOAD TEST INSTRUCTIONS

### ✅ **Download Issue Fixed!**

The download functionality has been completely fixed for Chrome. Here's what to test:

### 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

1. **Open the Flutter Web App** (should be running in Chrome now)
2. **Create a Surface:**
   - Add panels (e.g., 4×3 panels)
   - Select an LED type (e.g., Absen PL2.5 Lite)
   - Make sure calculations are complete

3. **Generate Pixel Map:**
   - Click "Generate Pixel Maps" or the export button
   - Watch for console messages in browser dev tools (F12)

4. **Expected Behavior:**
   ```
   🔄 Starting generation for surface: [Surface Name]
   ✅ Image generated: [X] bytes  
   💾 Attempting to download: [filename].png
   Web download triggered for: [filename].png
   ✅ Download completed for: [filename].png
   ```

5. **Download Results:**
   - Chrome will download PNG file to your Downloads folder
   - Success message: "✅ File downloaded: [filename].png"
   - Check Downloads folder for the generated pixel map

### 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Web Download**: Now uses proper `html.Blob` and browser download API
2. **Cloud Service**: Working at `https://led-pixel-map-service-1.onrender.com`
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages if download fails
4. **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages

### 🎯 **Expected File:**
- **Name**: `Pixel_Map_[resolution]_[project]_[surface]_[index].png`
- **Location**: Browser's Downloads folder
- **Content**: Professional pixel map with 15% numbering

### 🐛 **If Still Not Working:**
1. Check browser's download settings
2. Look for blocked downloads notification
3. Check console for error messages (F12 → Console tab)
4. Verify internet connection to cloud service
