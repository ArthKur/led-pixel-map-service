üéâ BORDER FIX SUCCESS SUMMARY
===============================================

## Issue Resolved ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Grid lines appeared as white lines instead of colored borders when visual overlays were added. Grid toggle button had no effect.

**Root Cause:** During visual overlay integration, the working border drawing logic from commit `576c32b` was accidentally replaced with the old broken version.

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

1. **Identified Working Version:** 
   - Found commit `576c32b` had proper colored borders
   - Version 15.0 contained the "PROPER BORDER FIX"

2. **Extracted Working Logic:**
   - Borders drawn WITHIN panel boundaries (not around them)
   - 40% brightness instead of 30%
   - Used `draw.line()` for precise pixel control

3. **Applied Fix:**
   - Restored working border drawing code
   - Preserved all visual overlay functionality  
   - Updated version to "15.0 - RESTORED BORDER FIX + Visual Overlays"

## Technical Details ‚úÖ

**Before (Broken):**
```python
# Draw 1-pixel brighter border around panel
border_color = brighten_color(panel_color, 0.3)
draw.rectangle([(x, y), (x + led_panel_width - 1, y + led_panel_height - 1)], outline=border_color)
```

**After (Fixed):**
```python
# Draw 1-pixel border WITHIN panel boundaries (last pixels of panel)
border_color = brighten_color(panel_color, 0.4)
# Top border - first row of panel
draw.line([(x, y), (x + led_panel_width - 1, y)], fill=border_color, width=1)
# Bottom border - last row of panel  
draw.line([(x, y + led_panel_height - 1), (x + led_panel_width - 1, y + led_panel_height - 1)], fill=border_color, width=1)
# Left border - first column of panel
draw.line([(x, y), (x, y + led_panel_height - 1)], fill=border_color, width=1)
# Right border - last column of panel
draw.line([(x + led_panel_width - 1, y), (x + led_panel_width - 1, y + led_panel_height - 1)], fill=border_color, width=1)
```

## Git History ‚úÖ

- **Commit:** `6eeee4d` - üîß RESTORE BORDER FIX: 40% brightness, within panel boundaries - fixes white lines
- **Deployed:** Successfully pushed to main branch and deployed to Render

## Status: COMPLETE ‚úÖ

üéØ **Problem Solved:** White lines eliminated, colored borders restored
üöÄ **Service Status:** Fully operational with both border fix and visual overlays
üì± **Flutter App:** Ready for production use
üåê **Cloud Service:** Version 15.0 deployed and working
